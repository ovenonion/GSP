# GSP--Taha,Anderson,Grayson and Shalin
Grade 12 computer studies group study project


The Main idea of our GSP is to take any image(.png or .jpg) and print it in ASCII art Takes an image and resizes it to a user imputed dimension. It then asks whether the user wants in color or black and white.

**In order to get best quality black and white image please choose a simple image with a contrasting foreground and background. Images printed in colour will only appear in colour in python console. You can not copy and paste a coloured ASCII image in colour.

-In pycharm, go to settings in the top right corner, click on preferences--->editor--->font, then change line height to 0.8 and then apply. This ensures the best dimension for the image.
